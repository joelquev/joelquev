## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**joelquev/joelquev** is my introduction repositoryâœ¨âœ¨

I'm a PhD Student working on High-Level Synthesis and Hardware Design, always interested in to hear about projects related to FPGAs, Evolutionary Algorithms and Compilers. Also, I'm familiar with compiler infrastructures such a LLVM/MLIR and the basics of Linux, TCL and Scripting. 

I have technical skills in VHDL (Design and Debug using Xilinx Vivado), MATLAB and Python programming. I'm currently exploring UVM for system verification with SystemVerilog.
